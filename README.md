## Introduction
Its a regression problem where we have to predict price of a laptop based on featues of laptop. This data contains lot a information packed in single columns, so I have performed feature
extraction and feature engineering to extract relevant features.

There are several steps involved in the process machine learning

• Data Gathering

• Feature Engineering

• Data Preprocessing

• Exploratory Data Analysis

• Model Building

• Model Optimization

• Model Selection

• Model Deployment


#### Evaluation
The model is evaluated on R2_score and mean absolute error.
